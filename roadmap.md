# Roadmap

Hello there :smiley:
 
Welcome to my Roadmap for my bioinformatics internship at ICIPE. It entails my milestones for this internship as well as a general milestone which will all help me attain my short-term and long-term visions of being a bioinformatics scientist.

Here is the link to my [Readme](https://github.com/Gatheru-rose/rose_bioinformatics_intern/blob/main/README.md) repository so as to know more about me and the internship.

## **What needs to be done**

---
**Milestone:**  Be conversant with R, python and Linux programming languages that are essential in genome analysis.
 
  - [ ] Learn [R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) syntax.
 
  - [ ] Learn [python](https://github.com/kipkurui/Python4Bioinformatics2019) syntax.
 
  - [x] Practice and learn [linux](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) commandline.
 
 **Milestone:** Ability to analyze and interpret genomic data using bioinformatic tools.
  
  - [ ] Enhancing my understanding in [genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/) from online resources.
  
  - [x] Advancing my skills in [bioinformatics](https://training.h3abionet.org/IBT_2017/).
  
  - [ ] Gaining essential skills in programming languages like [R](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/) necessary for genome data analysis.
  
  - [x] Learning how to come up with bioinformatics pipelines for genome analysis.
 
 **Milestone:** Advance in my research career by acquiring fellowships and opportunities.
  
  - [x]  Engage and participate in different workshops and seminars related to genomics research.
  
  - [x] Interact with different scientists especially bioinformatics scientists so as to get mentorship and learn from them.
  
  - [x] Enhance my knowledge in genomics by reading scientific journals and papers.
