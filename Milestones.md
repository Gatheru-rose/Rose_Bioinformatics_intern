# Roadmap

## **What needs to be done**

---
**Milestone:**  Be conversant with R, python and Linux programming languages that are essential in genome analysis.
 
  1. Learn [R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) syntax.
 
  2. Learn [python](https://github.com/kipkurui/Python4Bioinformatics2019) syntax.
 
  3. Practice and learn [linux](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) commandline.
 
 **Milestone:** Ability to analyze and interpret genomic data using bioinformatic tools.
  
  1. Enhancing my understanding in [genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/) from online resources.
  
  2. Advancing my skills in [bioinformatics](https://training.h3abionet.org/IBT_2017/).
  
  3. Gaining essential skills in programming languages like [R](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/) necessary for genome data analysis.
 
 **Milestone:** Advance in my research career by acquiring fellowships and opportunities.

**Steps to achieve the milestones**
 1. Learn syntax of programming languages.
 2. Learn skills in programming languages such as python, R and Linux from available resources that are useful in genomics and bioinformatics.
 3. Go through online programs that provide skills on genomic data analysis using bioinformatics tools.
