This internship comprises of a comprehensive introduction to bioinformatics to aspiring scientists who would like to venture in bioinformatics in one way or the other. The internship will also engage one in mini-projects under different bioinformatics teams where one will learn and practice skills. Additionally, journal clubs and meetings will lead to further exposure in presentation skills and interpreting scientific papers.

I am excited to begin this journey, interact and learn from the Bioinformaticians at ICIPE who will mould me into to great bioinformatics scientist.
