# Bioinformatics Intern Project

Hello. Welcome to my Bioinformatics Intern Project :smiley:

This repository gives a description of my vision for my Bioinformatics Internship at MBBU based at ICIPE. Additionally, there are steps that will guide me in achieving my short-term and long-term goals in research.

### **Vision**

To acquire knowledge and skills on how to use Bioinformatics tools and resources.

### **Mision**

To stand-out and become competitive in bioinformatics and genomics so that I can advance in my career through fellowships.

### **What I need to do**

**Milestones**
 1. Be conversant with programming languages that are essential in genome analysis.
 2. Ability to analyze and interpret genomic data.
 3. Advance in my research career by acquiring fellowships and opportunities.

**Steps to achieve the milestones**
 1. Learn syntax of programming languages.
 2. Learn skills in programming languages such as python, R and Linux from available resources that are useful in genomics and bioinformatics.
 3. Go through online programs that provide skills on genomic data analysis using bioinformatics tools.
