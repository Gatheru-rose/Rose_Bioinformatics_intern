# Bioinformatics Intern Project

Hello. Welcome to my Bioinformatics Intern Project :smiley:

My name is Rose Wambui, an MBBU bioinformatician intern at ICIPE. It is thrilling to beginning this bioinformatics internship where I shall learn various skills in bioinformatics and genomics and eventually become competitive in genomics, a field with solutions in understanding human diseases.

---
**Long-term Vision**- To become a bioinformatics scientists and contribute in the genomics field by understanding genomic make-up of organisms and their relation to diseases.

**Short-term Vision**- To enhance my knowledge in bioinformatics by learning various skills and resources hence standing-out so that I can acquire fellowships for my postgraduate studies.


### **What I need to do**

**Milestones**
 1. Be conversant with programming languages that are essential in genome analysis.
 2. Ability to analyze and interpret genomic data.
 3. Advance in my research career by acquiring fellowships and opportunities.

**Steps to achieve the milestones**
 1. Learn syntax of programming languages.
 2. Learn skills in programming languages such as python, R and Linux from available resources that are useful in genomics and bioinformatics.
 3. Go through online programs that provide skills on genomic data analysis using bioinformatics tools.
