# Bioinformatics Internship 

Hello. Welcome to my Bioinformatics Internship repository :smiley:

My name is Rose Wambui, an MBBU Bioinformatics intern at ICIPE. It is thrilling to beginning this bioinformatics internship where I shall learn various skills in bioinformatics and genomics and eventually become competitive in genomics, a field that am greatly interested in.

---
**Long-term Vision**- To become a bioinformatics scientists and contribute in the genomics field by understanding genomic make-up of organisms and their relation to diseases.

**Short-term Vision**- To enhance my knowledge in bioinformatics by learning various skills and resources hence standing-out so that I can acquire fellowships for my postgraduate studies.

This internship comprises of comprehensive introduction to bioinformatics to aspiring scientists who would like to venture into bioinformatics in one way or the other. There will be engagement in mini-projects in bioinformatics teams, whereby one will use the skills learnt and practice them further. Additionally, journal clubs and meetings will lead to further exposure on presentation skills and interpreting scientific papers.

I am excited to begin this journey, interact and learn from the Bioinformaticians at ICIPE who will mould me into to great bioinformatics scientist.
